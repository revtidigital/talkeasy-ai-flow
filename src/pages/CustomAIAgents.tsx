                      Not ready to commit to a $25K+ build? Start here. One week. $2,000 / ₹1,50,000 flat. We scope your
                      workflow, interview your team, prototype the core agent logic, and deliver a feasibility report —
                      technical architecture, cost/timeline estimate, risk flags, and a go/no-go recommendation. If we
                      build together, the fee is credited toward the build.

                      observability, evals, guardrails, error handling, model deprecation, scaling.
