    question: "How does RAG work on internal documents?",

      "We ingest your documents, split them into chunks, create vector embeddings, and store them in a vector database. When you ask a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and feeds them to an LLM to generate a grounded answer with citations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is enterprise RAG secure and private?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when built right. We deploy in your cloud, use permission-aware retrieval, and never train on your data. Open models for fully on-prem deployments.",

  {
    question: "RAG vs. fine-tuning — which is better for internal docs?",

      "Glean is SaaS, priced per-seat, generic enterprise search. We build custom RAG in your cloud, with domain-tuning, open models, and lower year-1 cost at most scales. Honest: Glean is the right call for some Fortune 500 buyers; we're a better fit for teams wanting control, accuracy, or air-gapped deployment.",

  {
    question: "How do you handle permissions — will employees see docs they shouldn't?",

  },
  {
