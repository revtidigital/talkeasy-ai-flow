    question: "Do you only work with our existing stack, or do we have to migrate?",

    question: "What AI models do you use — are we locked in?",

      "No lock-in. We pick the model, framework, and cloud that fits your use case — and you can swap later without a rebuild.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle data security and compliance?",

      "We deploy in your cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP/VPC) where required. We follow DPDP (India), GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA where applicable. No training on your data.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the typical engagement size and timeline?",

                      AI services are engagements where a specialist team scopes, builds, integrates, and runs AI systems
                      inside your business — strategy audits, custom AI agent development, voice AI, AI-powered automation,
                      AI integration with your existing CRM/ERP/helpdesk, and AI-native knowledge and sales systems.

                      The difference between AI tools and AI services: tools are software you buy and try to figure out.
                      Services are teams that build the AI that fits your workflow, deploy it with guardrails, and make sure
                      it works.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                      Most companies know AI can transform their operations. Far fewer know where to start, what's worth
                      building, or how to make it talk to the tools they already run on. That's the gap we close.
