    question: "How is this different from a Deloitte or BCG audit?",

  {
    question: "Does the audit cover data readiness, not just use cases?",

      "Yes. Data quality, integration, permissions, and governance are core to the assessment. Most pilots fail on data, not models.",

  {
    question: "What frameworks do you use?",
    answer:
      "Our ROI-First Audit framework — use-case scoring on business impact × technical feasibility × time-to-value × risk. Built from shipping 40+ AI projects. Frameworks are a starting point — your business context is the real input.",
