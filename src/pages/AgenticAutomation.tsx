  {
    question: "What is agentic process automation?",

      "APA uses LLM-powered agents that reason, read unstructured inputs, and make decisions — going beyond rule-based RPA. Agents handle the exceptions RPA used to escalate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is APA different from RPA?",
    answer:
      "RPA automates the happy path with deterministic rules. APA adds reasoning — so agents handle variations, unstructured data, and exceptions. Most companies run both: RPA for high-volume deterministic steps, APA for the messy middle.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to build an AI agent?",
    answer:
      "Our productized Agent Sprint is $9,995 flat for one production agent in 4 weeks. Larger programs range from $25K for complex bespoke builds (see Custom AI Agent Development) up to $500K+ for multi-BU programs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will agents hallucinate on financial data?",
    answer:
      "Not when designed correctly. Deterministic tool calls for irreversible actions, HITL approvals on high-risk steps, strict guardrails. Agents reason about the decision; the action is code.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we measure ROI?",
    answer:
      "Cycle time, cost-per-transaction, FTE hours reclaimed, exception rate, error rate. Metrics defined with you in week 1 and tracked weekly post-launch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does our data train your models?",
    answer:
      "No. We deploy in your cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) or via API providers with zero-retention settings. Your data stays yours.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the agent breaks?",
    answer:
      "Observability, eval harnesses, fallback workflows, and a monitored alerting channel. Breaks are visible in minutes, not discovered by customers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which processes can AI agents automate?",
    answer:
      "Back-office processes with structured or semi-structured inputs: invoices, tickets, reconciliation, onboarding, policy Q&A, ticket triage, approvals. If it involves reading unstructured data, making a decision, and updating systems, it’s agent-shaped.",
  },
  {
    question: "Build vs buy — why not just use UiPath Agents or Automation Anywhere?",
    answer:
      "Platform agents work for standard patterns. For deep custom logic, integration depth, or cost-sensitive mid-market, custom builds are 30–60% cheaper long-term and more flexible. We help you pick honestly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Timeline to first production agent?",
