    question: "How is this different from 11x or Artisan?",

    question: "Will my domain get blacklisted or my LinkedIn banned?",
    answer:
      "Not on our watch. We use dedicated secondary domains, enforced send caps per inbox, residential IPs for LinkedIn, and engagement-based warming. Zero banned accounts or burned primary domains so far.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who writes the copy — a human or an LLM?",

      "A human SDR-copywriter on our team, with their name attached to every campaign. AI assists with research and first-line personalization, but does not write sequences end-to-end.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the campaign doesn’t work in month 1?",
    answer:
      "Our pilot has explicit kill criteria defined in week 1. If we’re off at week 3, we pivot ICP, angle, or signal source with you. If we’re off at 6 weeks, the pilot ends and you pay only for qualified meetings booked.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and Gmail/Yahoo 2024 sender rules?",
    answer:
      "SPF, DKIM, DMARC, BIMI configured per domain. Unsubscribe links on every email. DNC + GDPR suppression lists maintained. Postmaster and seed tests monitored weekly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will this cannibalize our existing SDR team?",

      "Usually no. We run different plays than in-house SDRs — the speed-to-signal, niche-signal plays your team doesn’t want to interpret. We share data weekly to avoid overlap.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who owns the data and infrastructure?",
    answer:
      "Your CRM records and lead data are fully yours. The domains and inboxes stay under our operational control during engagement because we warm and maintain them. Offboarding includes full documentation and optional domain transfer.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long until the first meetings?",
    answer:
      "Typical: weeks 3–4 for first meetings, week 5 onward is steady state. Domain warming takes 2–3 weeks regardless of agency — no shortcut exists.",

    question: "Clay vs Apollo vs your setup — which do we need?",
